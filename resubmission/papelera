Research shows that greater perceived inequality fosters stronger preferences for redistribution, regardless of actual inequality levels [@garcia-sanchez_vicious_2019; @gimpelson_misperceiving_2018]. However, other findings suggest that heightened perceptions of income gaps between high- and low-paying occupations may lead to greater justification of inequality [@Castillo2011].

A less explored area in this regard concerns market justice, which denotes the degree to which individuals consider just that social goods and services (e.g., health, pensions, education) are allocated according to individual contribution, competition, and ability to pay [@lane_market_1986; @lindh_public_2015; @kluegel_legitimation_1999]. Market justice attitudes reflect the belief that the market promotes procedural fairness---equality of opportunity---so that outcomes result from individual achievement [@lane_market_1986]. Indeed, Lindh \[-\] shows that market justice preferences are stronger in countries with higher private spending on services than in those with more comprehensive welfare systems.

[lo de la interacción, me parece que es too much para la introducción]
The perception of meritocracy and the perception of economic inequality would interact intricately in shaping preferences for market justice. On the one hand, a stronger perception of merit as a criterion for distribution could minimize the perception of economic gaps, thus justifying an unequal system [@castillo_percepcion_2019; @mijs_paradox_2021]. On the other hand, the perception of inequality could moderate the impact of meritocracy, as a higher perception of economic gaps might challenge the idea that these are solely based on merit.
