\begin{abstract}
This study examines the interplay between perceptions of economic
inequality and meritocracy in shaping preferences for market justice in
Chile from 2016 to 2023. Economic inequality has intensified globally,
raising concerns about its social impacts and the legitimacy of
market-based distributions of resources. By utilizing longitudinal data
from the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey (ELSOC), the research
investigates how subjective assessments of inequality influence
attitudes towards social justice, focusing on the extent to which
individuals believe access to essential services like healthcare,
education, and pensions should depend on personal merit. The findings
suggest that as perceptions of economic inequality rise, individuals
tend to favor redistributive policies, although those with strong
meritocratic beliefs are more likely to justify existing inequalities.
The analysis also highlights the effect of major social movements in
Chile during this period, which have shifted public discourse and
potentially altered perceptions of inequality and meritocracy. This
paper contributes to the understanding of how individual beliefs about
fairness and equity evolve within a socio-political context
characterized by high inequality and extensive free-market principles.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Since 1980, economic inequality and wealth concentration have
dramatically increased worldwide, becoming one of the main challenges
for the social sciences. Globally, in 2021, less than 50\% of the world
population owned only 2\% of the wealth, while the richest 10\%
concentrated 76\%, and the wealthiest 1\% captured nearly 38\% of total
assets (\citeproc{ref-chancel_world_2022}{Chancel et al., 2022}). This
context of economic disparity has sparked renewed interest in studying
not only the objective aspects of inequality, such as income and access
to resources, but also its subjective dimensions, including perceptions,
beliefs, and associated attitudes
(\citeproc{ref-janmaat_subjective_2013}{Janmaat, 2013}). This has led,
among other reasons, to widespread concern in the social sciences about
the political delegitimization that economic inequality can produce
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_perception_2022}{Castillo et al., 2022}).
Understanding how people perceive inequality is crucial, as these
perceptions can influence how societies comprehend and justify the
distribution of goods and services.

The perception of economic inequality can be understood as an
individual's subjective assessment of how resources are allocated among
members of a given society (\citeproc{ref-akyelken_urban_2020}{Akyelken,
2020}). Regardless of their measurement, various studies have shown that
this perception often underestimates the gap between the rich and the
poor, which could have implications for attitudes toward the
distribution of goods and services
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_perception_2022}{Castillo et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-schroder_income_2017}{Schröder, 2017}). Moreover, in
recent years, there has been a discussion about the subjective and
objective aspects of inequality, demonstrating inconsistencies between
the two (\citeproc{ref-trump_income_2018}{Trump, 2018}). This tension is
relevant because advancing the study of perceptions could help
understand how perceived inequality affects the distribution of
resources within a society (Becker, 2020).

Perception of economic inequality has been associated with important
outcomes such as redistributive preferences, justification of
inequality, and legitimacy of the economic system
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_perception_2022}{Castillo et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_attitudes_2020}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2020}, \citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018}{2018}). Research
shows that greater perceived inequality fosters stronger preferences for
redistribution, regardless of actual inequality levels
(\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_vicious_2019}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2019}; \citeproc{ref-gimpelson_misperceiving_2018}{Gimpelson \&
Treisman, 2018}). However, other findings suggest that heightened
perceptions of income gaps between high- and low-paying occupations may
lead to greater justification of inequality
(\citeproc{ref-Castillo2011}{Castillo, 2011}). A less explored area in
this regard concerns market justice, which denotes the degree to which
individuals consider just that social goods and services (e.g., health,
pensions, education) are allocated according to individual contribution,
competition, and ability to pay
(\citeproc{ref-kluegel_legitimation_1999}{Kluegel et al., 1999};
\citeproc{ref-lane_market_1986}{Lane, 1986};
\citeproc{ref-lindh_public_2015}{Lindh, 2015}). Market justice attitudes
reflect the belief that the market promotes procedural
fairness---equality of opportunity---so that outcomes result from
individual achievement (\citeproc{ref-lane_market_1986}{Lane, 1986}).
Indeed, Lindh (\citeproc{ref-lindh_public_2015}{2015}) shows that market
justice preferences are stronger in countries with higher private
spending on services than in those with more comprehensive welfare
systems. From this perspective, perceptions of economic inequality may
be key, as lower perceived gaps can reinforce acceptance of free-market
systems and justify existing inequalities.

Meritocracy posits that inequality can be legitimized through
distributive criteria such as effort and talent
(\citeproc{ref-davis_principles_2001}{Davis \& Moore, 2001};
\citeproc{ref-young_rise_1962}{Young, 1962}). Previous studies have
demonstrated that people with stronger meritocratic beliefs tend to
perceive less inequality as they attribute economic differences to
individual achievements (\citeproc{ref-mijs_paradox_2021}{Mijs, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-wilson_role_2003}{Wilson, 2003}) and also to justify more
inequality as these beliefs are associated with attitudes that
legitimize status differences
(\citeproc{ref-batruch_belief_2023}{Batruch et al., 2023}). In a context
like Chile, where the distribution of goods and services is
predominantly governed by market logics strongly introduced during the
military dictatorship (1973-1989)
(\citeproc{ref-boccardo_30_2020}{Boccardo, 2020}), these beliefs can
play a crucial role in the acceptance of social inequalities.
Incorporating the perception of meritocracy in this literature allows
for an understanding of how attitudes toward inequality are shaped not
only by the perception of economic gaps, but also by beliefs about how
these gaps are justified. Furthermore, these beliefs are often
consolidated from an early age, reinforced by institutions promoting
values such as effort and individual skills to climb socially
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_socialization_2024}{Castillo et al., 2024};
\citeproc{ref-reynolds_perceptions_2014}{Reynolds \& Xian, 2014}).

The perception of meritocracy and the perception of economic inequality
would interact intricately in shaping preferences for market justice. On
the one hand, a stronger perception of merit as a criterion for
distribution could minimize the perception of economic gaps, thus
justifying an unequal system
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_percepcion_2019}{Castillo et al., 2012};
\citeproc{ref-mijs_paradox_2021}{Mijs, 2021}). On the other hand, the
perception of inequality could moderate the impact of meritocracy, as a
higher perception of economic gaps might challenge the idea that these
are solely based on merit.

The primary objective of this study is to analyze the interplay between
perceptions of inequality and meritocracy and their joint influence on
preferences for market justice in Chile from 2016 to 2023, using
longitudinal data from the ELSOC survey. This interaction is expected to
provide a more comprehensive explanation of attitudes toward market
justice in a country characterized by high inequality and strong
free-market influence (\citeproc{ref-boccardo_30_2020}{Boccardo, 2020};
\citeproc{ref-flores_top_2020}{Flores et al., 2020}). Additionally, this
analysis seeks to elucidate how political and social
contingencies---such as the 2019 and 2022 social movements---might have
moderated these relationships by prompting more critical reflection on
the commodification of social services. Recognizing the temporal
dimension in shaping market justice preferences is essential, given that
such preferences are not static but are influenced by historical and
contextual factors that challenge or reaffirm prevailing social norms.
In this regard, variations in perceived economic inequality and
meritocracy over time can affect how individuals endorse market-based
approaches. Consequently, public opinion may shift from supporting
market justice to embracing redistributive policies aimed at mitigating
inequalities.

\section{Theoretical views on market justice, inequality perception, and
meritocracy}\label{theoretical-views-on-market-justice-inequality-perception-and-meritocracy}

\subsection{The justification of market
inequality}\label{the-justification-of-market-inequality}

Conceptually, \emph{market justice} has been discussed in the literature
as a normative principle that legitimates the distribution of economic
rewards based on individual merit and effort. It is possible to trace
the concept to the understanding of Lane
(\citeproc{ref-lane_market_1986}{1986}), who defines market justice as a
system of ``earned deserts,'' whereby individuals are seen as deserving
of a determined distributive outcome due to their effort and skills. In
contrast, political justice, emphasizes principles of equality and need,
which are often represented by the welfare state action through social
policies. An important remark is that the principles of market justice
rely on the assumption that markets are neutral and self-regulating
arenas, where individuals are treated fairly because they face the same
formal rules of engagement (\citeproc{ref-lane_market_1986}{Lane,
1986}). Consequently, the legitimacy of market justice stems from the
assumption that inequalities are not only inevitable but fair---so long
as the rules are transparent and opportunities are open. In this way,
market justice provides a moral justification for inequality by framing
it as a necessary outcome of individual responsibility.

Empirical studies have shown different strategies for the study of
market justice preferences. A common approach in the literature is to
gauge attitudes toward the legitimacy of inequality in specific domains,
especially when linked to income differences. This can be traced to the
seminal work of Kluegel and Smith
(\citeproc{ref-kluegel_beliefs_1981}{1981}) who assessed the normative
foundations that explain public support for economic inequality. Over
time, this approach has been extended beyond income to include other
market-mediated outcomes, such as education, healthcare, and/or
pensions. For example, Von Dem Knesebeck et al.
(\citeproc{ref-vondemknesebeck_are_2016}{2016}) and Immergut and
Schneider (\citeproc{ref-immergut_it_2020}{2020}) examine whether
citizens consider it fair that individuals with higher incomes can
access better healthcare, while Lee and Stacey
(\citeproc{ref-lee_fairness_2023}{2023}) apply a similar method in the
context of education in Australia. These studies usually rely on a
survey item asking respondents to evaluate the fairness of income-based
access to welfare services, allowing for comparing justice perceptions
across different contexts. Similarly, comparative studies have also
relied on these indicators to study the support for market-based
distribution in welfare systems (\citeproc{ref-lindh_public_2015}{Lindh,
2015}; \citeproc{ref-svallfors_political_2007}{Svallfors, 2007}). More
recently, Castillo et al.
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_socialization_2024}{2024}) introduced a
single-item composite measure of market justice to assess student
attitudes toward income-based access to education, healthcare, and
pensions in Chile. These empirical strategies all aim to capture the
extent to which individuals accept inequality when framed as a
reflection of market outcomes.

The study of market justice preferences has increasingly focused on how
they are shaped by individuals' socioeconomic position, normative
beliefs, and the institutional context in which they are embedded.
Across the literature, there is empirical evidence suggesting that
individuals in more advantaged socioeconomic positions---those with
higher occupational class, income, and education---are more likely to
support market justice principles (\citeproc{ref-koos_moral_2019}{Koos
\& Sachweh, 2019}; \citeproc{ref-svallfors_political_2007}{Svallfors,
2007}). This tendency reflects not only material self-interest but also
a broader moral economy, in which winners of the market system
internalize justifications for the status quo. At the same time,
political ideology also plays a role ---such as economically
conservative values --- where more right-wing individuals show higher
support for meritocracy and more skepticism towards redistribution. This
is particularly salient in countries with more restricted public
provision of social services. For example, Castillo et al.
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_socialization_2024}{2024}) in Chile and, Lee and
Stacey (\citeproc{ref-lee_fairness_2023}{2023}) in Australia show that
those with right-leaning individuals are more supportive of market-based
distribution of welfare. Beyond individual characteristics,
country-level institutions also play a central role. In liberal welfare
regimes like those of the United States or the United Kingdom, market
justice preferences are more widespread, while in coordinated or
social-democratic regimes---such as Sweden or Germany---citizens are
generally more critical of market-based inequalities
(\citeproc{ref-immergut_it_2020}{Immergut \& Schneider, 2020};
\citeproc{ref-lindh_public_2015}{Lindh, 2015}). These findings suggest
that market justice is also shaped contextually, which is represented by
the development of welfare institutions.

\subsection{Perception of inequality}\label{perception-of-inequality}

Perceptions of inequality have been associated with attitudes about
market justice (\citeproc{ref-kluegel_social_1995a}{Kluegel et al.,
1995}; \citeproc{ref-lindh_public_2015}{Lindh, 2015}). Research
indicates that lower perceived inequality can reinforce support for
market-based distributive arrangements by suggesting that the system is
fair and that outcomes reflect effort and ability
(\citeproc{ref-kuhn_eye_2011}{Kuhn, 2011}). In contrast, when inequality
is perceived as excessive or structurally determined, individuals could
question the legitimacy of market justice and become more supportive of
redistributive policies
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_perception_2022}{Castillo et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_vicious_2019}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2019}).

Perceptions of inequality refer to individuals' subjective evaluations
of the extent, causes, and consequences of income and wealth
disparities. Unlike objective measures such as the Gini index, perceived
inequality captures how individuals make sense of distributive
hierarchies in their everyday lives, shaped by reference groups, social
comparisons, and information environments
(\citeproc{ref-garcia-castro_perceiving_2020}{García-Castro et al.,
2020}; \citeproc{ref-gimpelson_misperceiving_2018}{Gimpelson \&
Treisman, 2018}; \citeproc{ref-mijs_stratified_2016}{Mijs, 2016}).
Scholars have proposed multiple dimensions of perceived inequality,
including its magnitude (how significant are the gaps), vertical
structure (between which groups), the trend over time (increasing or
decreasing), and legitimacy (whether it is just or not)
(\citeproc{ref-engelhardt_what_2018}{Engelhardt \& Wagener, 2018};
\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_vicious_2019}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2019}). These dimensions encompass both cognitive and normative aspects
of perceptions of inequality and can vary across societies and social
groups, depending on exposure, ideology, and personal experience
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_perception_2022}{Castillo et al., 2022};
\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2018}).

Among the different approaches to measuring perceived inequality, one of
the most widely used is the estimation of wage gaps between occupational
extremes, such as between a CEO and a manual worker. This type of item
provides a concrete frame that respondents can relate to more easily
than abstract questions about national income distribution
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_percepcion_2019}{Castillo et al., 2012};
\citeproc{ref-easterbrook_social_2021}{Easterbrook, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-willis_legitimacy_2015}{Willis et al., 2015}). While it
enables the estimation of inequality using simple heuristics, this
method is not without challenges. For instance, people often lack
reliable knowledge about the earnings of those at the top of the income
ladder, which leads to high variability in responses and the use of
biased mental shortcuts (\citeproc{ref-knell_perceptions_2020}{Knell \&
Stix, 2020}). Despite this, perceived wage gaps are strong predictors of
political attitudes
(\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_perceptions_2018}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2018}; \citeproc{ref-pedersen_attitudes_2019}{Pedersen \& Mutz, 2019}),
making them a valuable tool for understanding public responses to
economic disparities.

Another relevant critique of this approach lies in its conflation of
different psychological constructs. Many surveys assess perceived
inequality through Likert-type items that ask respondents to agree or
disagree with statements, such as ``income differences are too large,''
which captures general concern or discomfort rather than a specific
perception (\citeproc{ref-Castillo2011}{Castillo, 2011};
\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_vicious_2019}{García-Sánchez et al.,
2019}). These items mix cognitive estimations with affective
evaluations, complicating the interpretation of what respondents
perceive versus what they morally reject. As a result, the conceptual
clarity between perceived inequality and inequality aversion remains
blurred in many empirical studies. To address this limitation, recent
work has emphasized the need to distinguish between absolute and
comparative measures, as well as between ideal and actual estimates of
economic gaps (\citeproc{ref-auspurg_why_2017}{Auspurg et al., 2017};
\citeproc{ref-garcia-sanchez_creencias_2022}{García-Sánchez \& De
Carvalho, 2022}).

\subsection{Perception of meritocracy}\label{perception-of-meritocracy}

Meritocracy constitutes a central ideological framework for legitimizing
different types of social inequality, for instance through market
justice beliefs. Rooted in the belief that rewards and positions should
be allocated based on individual effort and talent, meritocracy operates
as a normative ideal and a descriptive belief about how society
functions. As initially conceptualized by Michael Young
(\citeproc{ref-young_rise_1962}{1962}), the term was meant to critique a
system in which merit-based stratification becomes a new form of
inequality. However, over time, meritocracy has been widely supported in
many societies as a fair and desirable principle of distribution,
particularly within liberal democracies and market-oriented economies
(\citeproc{ref-mijs_paradox_2021}{Mijs, 2021};
\citeproc{ref-sandel_tyranny_2020}{Sandel, 2020}). From a sociological
perspective, the belief in meritocracy is more than a cognitive
assessment; it reflects a moral lens through which individuals interpret
inequality. People who believe that success results from hard work and
talent are more likely to view social and economic disparities as
legitimate (\citeproc{ref-batruch_belief_2023}{Batruch et al., 2023};
\citeproc{ref-castillo_percepcion_2019}{Castillo et al., 2012}).
Conversely, if they see outcomes as driven by luck, social origin, or
systemic barriers, inequality is more likely to be perceived as unjust.
This distinction becomes crucial in societies with persistent structural
inequality, where public narratives often emphasize personal
responsibility and merit while overlooking entrenched disadvantages.

We adopt a multidimensional perspective on meritocracy, distinguishing
between two key dimensions: effort-based and talent-based perceptions.
This distinction is essential, as it captures different pathways through
which individuals justify inequality. Effort-based meritocracy
emphasizes hard work and perseverance as the basis for social rewards,
aligning closely with cultural narratives of personal responsibility. A
talent-based meritocracy, by contrast, emphasizes intelligence and
innate abilities, which are often perceived as less malleable and more
unequally distributed. Both dimensions have been shown to correlate with
acceptance of inequality, but they may carry distinct implications for
how inequality is justified in specific domains
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_multidimensional_2023}{Castillo et al., 2023}).
The relevance of this distinction is supported by recent studies, which
show that individuals respond differently to these dimensions. For
instance, perceptions that effort is rewarded in society are more
strongly associated with positive evaluations of fairness and acceptance
of unequal outcomes (\citeproc{ref-batruch_belief_2023}{Batruch et al.,
2023}). This may be because effort is seen as a controllable and morally
virtuous trait, whereas talent is often perceived as a natural
advantage. Consequently, effort-based meritocracy is likely more potent
in legitimizing inequality, particularly in neoliberal contexts.

These dimensions of meritocracy reflect how respondents perceive
society's distributive logic, regardless of whether they endorse
meritocratic principles. This distinction aligns with recent findings
indicating that individuals distinguish between how merit is perceived
in society and how it should ideally operate, which in turn shapes their
preferences for redistribution and justice
(\citeproc{ref-tejero-peregrina_perceived_2025}{Tejero-Peregrina et al.,
2025}) Meritocratic beliefs serve as symbolic justifications for unequal
outcomes, particularly when access is stratified by income or social
opportunity. Prior studies have shown that individuals who perceive
higher levels of meritocracy tend to express stronger support for
unequal distributions that reflect market outcomes
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_percepcion_2019}{Castillo et al., 2012};
\citeproc{ref-castillo_socialization_2024}{Castillo et al., 2024}).

In addition to influencing individual attitudes toward inequality,
meritocratic beliefs can contribute to social division and the
stigmatization of disadvantaged groups. Recent research has demonstrated
that exposure to meritocratic narratives can reinforce the belief that
poverty results from individual failings rather than systemic
conditions, reducing support for redistributive measures and increasing
the stigmatization of the poor (\citeproc{ref-hoyt_mindsets_2023}{Hoyt
et al., 2023}). This reinforces negative stereotypes and reduces empathy
toward individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Moreover,
Busemeyer et al. (\citeproc{ref-busemeyer_positive_2021}{2021}) argues
that meritocratic narratives can serve as feedback mechanisms that shape
public opinion and well-being by framing individuals' understanding of
welfare outcomes as deserved or undeserved within existing institutional
structures. This psychological mechanism highlights the normative power
of meritocracy in stabilizing unequal systems by shaping political
attitudes and personal perceptions of success and failure.

\subsection{This study}\label{this-study}

Building upon the previous literature, this study proposes that
attitudes toward market justice are shaped by a dynamic interplay
between individuals' perceptions of economic inequality and their
beliefs in meritocracy. Specifically, we argue that both perceptions
independently and interactively influence the extent to which
individuals endorse market-based distributions of social goods and
services in Chile.

First, consistent with previous findings, we expect that a lower
perception of economic inequality will be associated with stronger
market justice preferences. When individuals perceive smaller income
gaps, they are more likely to view market mechanisms as fair and
legitimate, reinforcing the acceptance of outcomes based on competition
and ability to pay. Conversely, a heightened perception of inequality
may erode confidence in market fairness, weakening support for
market-based distribution. This relationship is particularly relevant in
the context of Chile, where the neoliberal economic model has been a
dominant force in shaping public attitudes toward inequality and
justice.

Second, higher perceived meritocracy is expected to be positively
associated with market justice preferences. Individuals who believe that
effort and talent primarily determine success are more likely to justify
unequal outcomes and endorse the notion that markets allocate resources
fairly according to individual merit. This aligns with the idea that
meritocratic beliefs serve as a moral framework that legitimizes
market-based inequalities, as individuals perceive the system as just
when they believe that rewards are based on individual merit. This is
particularly relevant in contexts where neoliberal ideologies dominate,
as they often emphasize individual responsibility and competition as the
basis for social order.

Third, we propose that perceptions of meritocracy and perceptions of
economic inequality interact in shaping market justice attitudes.
Specifically, we argue that the legitimizing effect of perceived
meritocracy on market justice preferences is moderated by perceived
economic inequality: when perceived inequality is low, the positive
association between meritocratic beliefs and market justice preferences
will be stronger. However, when perceived inequality is high, this
association will weaken, as greater awareness of large economic gaps may
challenge the view that outcomes are purely merit-based.

Additionally, this study examines whether these relationships vary over
time in response to significant social and political events. In
particular, we explore whether the political outburst of 2019 and the
subsequent constitutional processes in Chile have altered how
perceptions of inequality and meritocracy shape market justice
attitudes. We expect that after these critical events, perceptions of
inequality may have a stronger negative effect on market justice
preferences, reflecting increased societal questioning of market-based
allocation mechanisms.

Based on these arguments, we propose the following hypotheses:

\(H1\): Higher perceived economic inequality is associated with higher
market justice preferences.

\(H2\): Higher meritocratic beliefs are associated with higher market
justice preferences.

\(H3\): The positive association between meritocratic beliefs and market
justice preferences is moderated by perceived economic inequality;
specifically, this association is weaker when perceived economic
inequality is high.

\(H4\): The effects described in H1--H3 are attenuated after major
social mobilizations (2019--2022), reflecting increased critical views
of the market's role in allocating social goods.

\section{Data, Variables and Methods}\label{data-variables-and-methods}

\subsection{Data}\label{data}

This study draws on data from the Chilean Longitudinal Social Survey
(ELSOC), a panel study collected annually from 2016 to 2023. The survey
evaluates how individuals think, feel, and behave regarding conflict and
social cohesion in Chile. ELSOC employs a probabilistic, stratified,
clustered, multistage sampling design encompassing major urban centers
(Santiago, Valparaíso, and Concepción) and smaller cities. The target
population includes women and men aged 18--75 who are habitual residents
of private dwellings. The first wave included 2,927 participants,
representing northern and southern regions, covering 77\% of the
country's total population and 93\% of its urban population, with a
response rate of 62.4\% (\citeproc{ref-elsoc_estudio_2022}{ELSOC,
2022}).

The survey has been conducted yearly since 2016, except in 2020, when it
was suspended due to the pandemic. Waves 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2022,
and 2023 used computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI), while a
reduced wave in 2021 employed computer-assisted telephone interviews
(CATI). Wave 3 included a refreshment sample (N = 1,519) to counter
attrition, but these cases are not used here to capture longer response
trends. Between wave 1 and wave 7, attrition amounted to 40\%, achieving
a final sample of N = 1,741. Longitudinal weights adjust for both the
sampling design and potential biases arising from systematic
non-participation. Further details on sampling, attrition, and weighting
can be found at \url{https://coes.cl/encuesta-panel/}, and the dataset
is publicly available at
\url{https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/elsoc}.

\subsection{Variables}\label{variables}

\textbf{Market justice preferences}: The dependent variable in this
study is preferences for market justice. This construct is
operationalized through three items that capture how strongly
individuals justify conditioning access to social services---healthcare,
pensions, and education---on income. Specifically, the justification of
inequality in healthcare is assessed by the question: ``Is it fair in
Chile that people with higher incomes can access better healthcare than
people with lower incomes?'' The same question is posed for pensions and
education. In all cases, respondents indicate their level of agreement
on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (``strongly disagree'') to 5
(``strongly agree''). Additionally, we include a composite measure of
``market justice preferences'', calculated as the average of these three
items (\(\alpha\) = 0.84). This index ranges from 1 to 5, with higher
values indicating stronger preferences for market justice (see
Table~\ref{tbl-summary1}).

\textbf{Perception of economic inequality}: The main independent
variable refers to the perception of economic inequality, measured
through the perceived wage gap.
(\citeproc{ref-castillo_cual_2009}{Castillo, 2009};
\citeproc{ref-gijsberts_thelegitimation_1999}{Gijsberts, 1999};
\citeproc{ref-hadler_why_2005}{Hadler, 2005}). This measure is derived
from the salary gap between the perceived salaries of jobs at opposite
ends of the occupational hierarchy. Specifically, it relies on the
division between the perceived salary of a large-company president and
that of an unskilled worker (\citeproc{ref-Castillo2011}{Castillo,
2011}). Higher values of this term indicate a greater perception of
economic inequality between occupations located at the extremes of the
status continuum. This measure includes a logarithmic term in order to
adjust income magnitudes (usually fewer cases with high income):

\[
\text{perceived wage gap} = \log_{10}\left(\frac{\text{perceived salary of a large-company president}}{\text{perceived salary of an unskilled worker}}\right)
\]

\textbf{Perception of Meritocracy}: this variable is operationalized
through two components, namely effort and talent
(\citeproc{ref-young_rise_1962}{Young, 1962}). The item used to gauge
effort is: ``In Chile, people are rewarded for their efforts,'' while
the item for talent is: ``In Chile, people are rewarded for their
intelligence and skills''. In both cases, respondents indicate their
level of agreement on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1
(``strongly disagree'') to 5 (``strongly agree'').

and their frequencies.

\emph{Controls}

Sociodemographic and attitudinal variables are included to control for
potential composition effects in the population. In terms of
sociodemographic characteristics, we incorporate per capita household
income quintile, educational level (1=Less than Universitary,
2=Universitary), age (in years), and sex (1=Male, 2=Female), which have
been previously shown to influence market justice preferences
significantly (\citeproc{ref-castillo_socialization_2024}{Castillo et
al., 2024}; \citeproc{ref-lindh_public_2015}{Lindh, 2015}). Regarding
attitudinal variables, we include political identification (1=Left,
2=Center, 3=Right, 4=No identification) and subjective social status
(ranging from 1 to 10) as they may confound the relationship between
market justice preferences and perceptions of inequality and meritocracy
(\citeproc{ref-schneider_poverty_2015}{Schneider \& Castillo, 2015}).

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

Given the data's hierarchical structure, in which observations are
nested in survey waves, we employ longitudinal multilevel linear models
(\citeproc{ref-singer_applied_2009}{Singer \& Willett, 2009}). In a
panel-data framework, within-person effects capture how shifts in
individual-level variables across waves are associated with variations
in market justice preferences. By contrast, between-person effects focus
on differences among individuals, explaining how long-term (or average)
values relate to overall levels of market justice preferences.

To estimate within-person effects, we use group-mean centering, where
each respondent functions as the ``group'' (i.e., observations nested
within persons). Meanwhile, the between-person effects are derived from
each individual's average on these variables, calculated across the
waves of panel data.

All the analyses were conducted using R software and the \emph{lme4}
package (\citeproc{ref-bates_fitting_2015}{Bates et al., 2015}).

\section{Results}\label{results}

\subsection{Descriptive}\label{descriptive}

Figure~\ref{fig-alluvial} shows the annual frequencies of market justice
preferences for healthcare, pensions, and education from 2016 to 2023.
Each year presents stacked percentage frequencies, and the flows between
them reflect opinion changes among the same individuals from one year to
the next, given that we are using panel data. For instance, of the
40.8\% who strongly disagreed with justifying inequality in healthcare
in 2019, around 24.3\% maintained that position in 2022, while the
remaining 16.5\% shifted toward other response categories---primarily
moving into disagreement rather than strong disagreement. Overall, more
than half of the respondents exhibit a high level of disagreement
(disagree + strongly disagree) with inequality in these three social
service areas over time. Despite this general pattern, recent waves show
a slight decrease in disagreement and a corresponding rise in support
for inequality. Specifically, in healthcare and education, although
disagreement remains substantial, agreement (agree + strongly agree)
increased from 7.4\% and 7.2\% in 2019 to 13.1\% and 14.2\% in 2023,
respectively. This shift is most evident in pensions, where the combined
agree/strongly agree category grew by about 10 percentage points, from
16.9\% in 2016 to 28\% in 2023.

}

\end{figure}%

Regarding the main variables of this study, Figure~\ref{fig-meanchange}
depicts their average changes over the years. We observe an increase in
the average level of market justice preferences in the most recent
waves, which begins in 2019. The highest average consistently appears
for perceived economic inequality, although this variable shows a
downward trend of roughly one point over time. Interestingly, while
perceptions of economic inequality declined in the latest measurements
(2022--2023), market justice preferences increased. The meritocracy
measures remain stable, though the perception that individuals are
rewarded for intelligence is slightly higher than the perception that
they are rewarded for their effort.

}

\end{figure}%

Figure~\ref{fig-matrix} presents the correlation matrix for the main
variables in the latest wave (2023). Overall, the coefficients range
from low to moderate. The association between market justice preferences
and economic inequality perception is negative but small and
statistically significant (\(r\) = -0.05, \(p\) \textless{} .05). By
contrast, market justice preferences positively and significantly
correlate with the two meritocracy variables (\(r\) = 0.15, \(p\)
\textless{} .01; \(r\) = 0.13, \(p\) \textless{} .01). Perceived
economic inequality has negative and nonsignificant correlations with
both meritocracy perceptions (\(r\) = -0.04, \(p\) \textgreater{} .05;
\(r\) = -0.04, \(p\) \textgreater{} .05). Finally, the two meritocracy
variables exhibit a strong positive association with each other (\(r\) =
0.69, \(p\) \textless{} .01).

\subsection{Multilevel models}\label{multilevel-models}

Table~\ref{tbl-modelos} presents the results of the multilevel models
estimated for market justice preferences, examining both individuals
(within) and group-level (between) effects. The intraclass correlation
(\citeproc{ref-hoxMultilevelAnalysisTechniques2017a}{Hox et al., 2017})
from the empty model (see Supplementary Material), which decomposes the
variance of market justice preferences, is 0.23, indicating that
approximately 23\% of the variation is attributable to differences
between individuals. Complementary, 77\% of the variation corresponds to
within-individual differences over time.

According to Model 1, which includes the survey waves to capture
intertemporal variations in the dependent variable, there is a decrease
in 2017 (\(\beta\) = -0.167, \(p\) \textless{} .001) relative to 2016,
and similarly in 2018 (\(\beta\) = -0.025, \(p\) \textgreater{} .05) and
2019 (\(\beta\) = -0.046, \(p\) \textgreater{} .05), although the latter
effects are not statistically significant. In contrast, in the more
recent waves of 2022 and 2023, there is a statistically significant
increase in market justice preferences (\(\beta\) = 0.285, \(p\)
\textless{} .001; \(\beta\) = 0.284, \(p\) \textless{} .001), suggesting
a non-linear effect. To model this trajectory over time, Model 2
incorporates time (survey waves) as a continuous variable, along with
its quadratic term, representing the non-linear association initially
observed in Model 1. While the linear term (survey wave) shows a
negative association, reflecting an overall decline in market
preferences over time, the positive quadratic term indicates a reversal
of this pattern in the final measurement points.

Models 3 and 4 incorporate the within-group effects (WE) of the primary
independent variables, capturing how individual changes in these
variables over time shape the dependent variable. The results in Model 3
suggest that the within effect of perceived economic inequality is
negative and statistically significant (\(p\) \textless{} .001).
Specifically, each one-point increase in an individual's perception of
economic inequality between waves is associated with a 0.034 point
decrease in market justice preferences. Model 4 shows that meritocratic
beliefs operate in the opposite direction. An upward shift in the
perception that effort is rewarded exerts a positive within effect
(\(\beta\) = 0.071, \(p\) \textless{} .001), and a parallel increase in
the perception that intelligence and ability are rewarded is likewise
associated with higher market-justice preferences (\(\beta\) = 0.028,
\(p\) \textless{} .05). Taken together, these results suggest that
individuals who increasingly perceive meritocracy---whether through
effort or talent---tend to hold stronger market justice preferences.

When examining the between-group effects (BE) in Model 5 and 6, which
capture differences between individuals in the average of the main
variables, a similar pattern emerges. Individuals who perceive higher
levels of economic inequality tend to prefer less market justice
(\(\beta\) = -0.042, \(p\) \textless{} .05). In Model 6, the
meritocratic perception that effort is rewarded is positively associated
with market justice preferences (\(\beta\) = 0.186, \(p\) \textless{}
.001), whereas the perception that talent is rewarded shows a positive
but non-significant coefficient (\(\beta\) = 0.040). Notably, once the
meritocratic variables are included, the negative coefficient for
perceived economic inequality remains but is no longer statistically
significant.

Model 7 adds the control variables. With the exception of the
between-effect for perceived economic inequality---which becomes
nonsignificant---the within- and between-effects of the principal
predictors retain both their direction and statistical significance,
confirming the robustness of the associations (see Supplementary
Material for effects of control variables).

Table~\ref{tbl-interactions1} reports whether perceived economic
inequality moderates the impact of meritocratic perceptions on
market-justice preferences. In neither the within-person specification
(Model 8) nor the between-person specification (Model 9) do the
interaction terms reach statistical significance, indicating that higher
perceptions of economic inequality do not meaningfully alter the effect
of meritocracy on support for market allocation of social services.

With respect to the temporal dynamics of the key predictors,
Figure~\ref{fig-growth} illustrates the interaction between survey wave
and the within-person effects of the meritocracy variables on
market-justice preferences (complete models appear in the Supplementary
Material). As time advances, the positive within-person effect of
perceiving that effort is rewarded (panel A) or that intelligence is
rewarded (panel B) progressively attenuates. Put differently, the uplift
in market justice preferences associated with a strong meritocratic
perception becomes smaller in each successive wave.
